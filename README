Problem description: "Create 6 Docker containers from Docker Image: https://hub.docker.com/r/critoma/linux-u20-dev-security-ism
for zooming in/out a large BMP picture. Please draw the architecture in draw.io/diagrams.net/Visio/ or equivalent Tools and implement the following requirements.

The picture is received from the Front-end (Plain JS/CSS/HTML or Angular or Vue.js or REACT) into the 1st container Back-End via REST API (Javalin or Jakarta EE Servlet REST API) and then is published as binary message into a JMS Topic from the 2nd container which is a MoM JMS Broker. In the 3rd container a Jakarta EE EJB MDB is subscribed to the 2nd container JMS Topic and it is also Java RMI Client for 2 Java RMI Servers which are running in the 4th and 5th containers. When the BMP picture is ready, then it is stored in 6th container MySQL DB as BLOB - Binary Large Object. The 6th container has 2 DBs - one MongoDB for collecting SNMP values from all the nodes regarding OS name, CPU and RAM usage and a MySQL DB for storing modified pictures. All these are exposed through node.js JS Express REST Endpoints - one for SNMP values display and one for BMP picture rendering. When the zoomed BMP pic is inserted in the MySQL, then the 1st container via REST API/WebSocket is notifying the front-end with HTTP redirection to the node.js URL for downloading the picture. As a list there are the following containers:

Front-end (JS, Angular, Vue.js) -> load pic&params(Zoom In/Out, +/- %) via REST API 
-> C01: Java Javalin/Apache Tomcat 10 Microserv + JMS Client Publisher
-> C02: Apache TomEE 10 w JMS Broker - Topic & Queues
-> C03: Apache TomEE 10 w EJB Client MDB & RMI Client <- zoom pics united into DB via REST API & JMS Client Publisher in Topic/Queue that the job is done
-> C04, C05: Apache TomEE 10 w RMI Server objects
<- C01: Notification that the pic is ready => in the front-end with link for download from node.js C06
-> C06: REST API in node.js w MongoDB with 2 REST API endpoints interfaces: 1 for DB access and 1 for Web Access
